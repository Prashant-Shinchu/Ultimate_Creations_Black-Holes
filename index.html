                In general terms a black holes are formed when you get enough mass into a small enough volume, like the 
                mass of the planet earth into a volume of single penny.The best mechanism in the universe has to do such phenomenan 
                is "Gravity". Lets say we have a star which has a mass 20 times greater than our sun, the core of the stars are made of 
                iron, but it doesn't stay iron for much longer. At the end of it's life cycle the core of the star collapse by it's own 
                gravity and form a "Neutron Star". That is a ball of neutrons about the size of a small city & it continue to collapse
                by it's gravity into such a small volume so that the "Space-Time" is curved to an extremely small region. A perfectly black bubble 
                formed that we call the "Event Horizon" & that is a "Black-Hole". You actually cann't draw the inner structure of a "Black-Hole"
                because you cann't see what lies after the "Event-Horizon" thats why we call it "Black-Hole". Since the "General-Relativity" was
                published in 1915 by "Albert Einstein", "Black-Holes" were the well known subjects to do research and calculations by
                many scientists. One of the main reasons for this is that it deals with the "Quantum-Mechanics" & "Gravity(Curvature of Space-Time)".
                The term "Black-Hole" was coined in late 1960's.

            <h4 class="py-3">They aren,t dengerous</h4>
            <p class="pb-3">All the wierd stuff happens at a black-hole happens actually inside the event-horizon, at the region of it's singularity. As much the 
                core collapse, it makes more space accessible around it. Gravity dosn't get effected outside of a black-hole. The Accretion Disk that i mentioned 
                before was actually formed by the matters and light, yes "Light" also rotate in circular motion outside of a black-hole
                because even light can not escape from it's gravity. Outside that region the orbital plane is normal any object orbiting the black-hole.
                Black-Holes rotate in their own orbital zone, they don't travel like a space-craft wondering in outer-space. So, they provide essential balance to our universe.

            <h4 class="py-3">Schwarzschild radius</h4>
            <p class="pb-3">The size of the event-horizon is called "Schwarzchild Radius". The more mass or matter we feed to a black-hole the size of it's
                event-horizon will increase and the mass of the black-hole also increases, simply black-holes grow as they eat. A horizon is a boundary
                we can't see beyond, thats why it has a beautiul name "The Event-Horizon". Event-Horizon is a boundary hiding the events from view.
                As in Space-Time events. When a neutron star collapse before becoming a black hole, it has to collapse within it's own boundary or it's own region of space-time
                which latter becomes the The "Event-Horizon" Which is the outer edge of the "Black-Hole".

          <div class="col-md-4 text-center wow animated zoomIn">
            <h4 class="py-3">Missing part of universe</h4>
            <p class="pb-3">Yes, it is true that the black-holes & all the events happen inside black-holes are not part of this universe or the space-time we see 
                & experience around us, because a normal stellar mass black-hole has the mass of atleast "3 Suns" which gets compressed in a small dense region so that 
                the space-time around it curved at very extreme level & the space-time literally becomes black leaving no signs of any matter 
                or light anymore. The biggest puzzle is that what actually lies inside the "Singularity" which is still mind boggling
                to many scientists. All this obsrvations and data we have till this date tells that black-holes aren't the part of our Space-Time.

          There are generally two types of black holes, one is static and another one is rotating. The static black holes have two parts #1 is the event-horizon & #2 is the dense singularity under the event-horizon.
          The rotating black-holes have two event-horizons and a singularity(also called ringularity). We can only study upto ouside of the event-horizon because after that the laws of physics doesn't even work inside a black hole.
          We have three general terms to describe a rotating black-hole in detail |<a href="#">#1. Mass(Energy)</a>| <a href="#">#2. Charge</a>| <a href="#">#3. Angular Momentum</a>|.
          Mass is easily detectable due to the highly curved space-time or more massive objects orbiting around it.
          Charge can be also detectable because it lives outside the event-horizon but they quickly attract opposite charges & become neutral.
          Unlike charge, Spin(Angular Momentum) is a prcess that black-holes definitely have. Due to high mass with low volume it's speed increases
          & the speed at which a black hole normally rotate is 1million miles/hour or 1/10th of the speed of light.
          The best thing about spinning black holes is that they can increase their angular momentum by eating more matter & they'll speed themselves over time.
          The Supermassive Black-hole(Sagittarius A*) at the center of aur milkey way galaxy is spinning upto 30% of the speed of light.

                <h3 class="py-3">The Ergosphere</h3>
                <p class="pb-3">The ergosphere is a wiered region of space just ouside the event-horizon. As the black-hole spin it also drag the space-time with it.
                    As well as any matter & light in that space-time. We call it frame dragging 'cause the entire frame of reference can be dragged along with the black-hole spin.
                    Inside the ergosphere the frame is dragged so much that it is literally impossible for you to sit still, no matter how much thrust you  have.
                    Stationary path is not possible. The black-holes slow down by loosing more & more rotating energy. We already know that nothing can escape from the event-horizon
                    , so that energy must be in space-time or outside the event-horizon. The ergosphere is the thing which makes the rotating black-holes so special,
                    because it drag the space-time around it like a sheet of paper or a cloth. The rotation energy lies outside of the black hole so we can steal it from 
                    the black-hole & make it non-rotating black-hole. In time in far future rotating black-holes will be the only source of energy left in this universe after all the white dwarfs and black dwarfs die.

    <div class="explain mt-3 wow animated bounceIn">
        When you say lets make a black-hole which we know that we just need to compress a gaint star upto a very small region of space, but you know that small region we are talking about is really! really! really! smaaaaaaaaaal.
        It means that if we have a star 10 times more mass than our Sun having diameter of billions of km across than we have to shrink it down upto a size of small city, for example - only upto 15-17 km in diameter. Yes thats insanely small space for such a gaint star.
        That small space will have the same mass when it was a star like in million times greater, exa.->3.989 Ã— 10^90 kg or even more, which is normal for such phenomenan.
        The space occupied by non rotating black hole is given by something called <a href="#">"the schwarzchild radius"</a>. We can't determine the actual size of a black-hole
        'cause we can only see the event-horizon, the actual black-hole lies inside of it which we know as the singularity, what is in there?, how much region it contains?, is it infinite?.
        One thing is clear that the classical mechanics doesn't apply to a black-hole. Another term is that the Gravity is Curvature of Space-Time which is caused by energy, it means that
        if I say we need 10 times more mass of the Sun, it actually means 10 times more energy of the Sun.

                <p class="pb-3 wow animated bounceIn">A black hole formed from the death of a neutron star, a giant ball of neutrons which means that neutrons are quantum particles and if you don't understand the quantization of neutron stars than you cann't even understand the black-hole
                    which tells that quantum particles are never objects, they are waves. Specifically they are quantum probability waves which means we need two thinks to be understood--> <a href="#">#1. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle</a> & <a href="#">#2. Pauli Exclusion Principle</a>. 
                    According to "Pauli Exclusion Principle" the fermions(Neutrons, Protons & Electrons) occupy the same state or position, if a neutron bump into another one that will also accupy the same amount of space as they had before.
                    The more mass a neutron star has the smaller it is, now in this case the "Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle" comes in. To visualize the <a href="#">the standard deviation</a> which is an idea of spread possible values, lets say we have something called 
                    "position-space" & "momentum-space" by which the visualization shows that as the "position-space" shrinks, the "momentum-space" expands & vice versa. So the neutons in neutron star shrink down in "position-space" as the neutron get closure to each other & expands in "momentum-space",
                    such phenomenan is relative to each other to form a black-hole.

                <h4 class="py-3 wow animated zoomIn">#2. Why can't you escape a black-hole?</h4>
                <p class="pb-3 wow animated bounceIn">Even some of the best & powerful things in the universe like Galaxies, Stars, Light, Gravity, Hawking Radiation, literally nothing can escape a black-hole because its totally separated from space-time.
                    The term <a href="#">escape velocity</a> [<span>&#8730;v=2GM/R</span>] come into picture which is the highest possible velocity needed to escape a powerful gravitation field. As far as we have concerned that 
                    "gravity is a geometry" in 3 dimentional space & 4th dimentional time, the event horizon is the second singularity of a black-hole called "coordinate singularity" which means we can remove it by changing it's coordinates.
                    A distant observer sees a problem at the event-horizon but a person falling into a black-hole does not, event-horizon has nothing to do with escape-velocity, its about <a href="#">causality</a>,
                    its about time. lets say a person is travelling in empty space straight in time(possible paths in future) & as the person gets closure to a black-hole & when that person falls into it the time is now curved for that 
                    person & all possible future of that person points inward the event-horizon, even if that person tries to send singnal, it will also goes inward no matter which direction that signal is in. Ones you are inside there is 
                    no such thing as outward. The conclusion is that black-holes don't capture objects & light, they capture "The Future".

                  Black-holes die by evaporating hawking-radiation escaping the black-hole.
                  If you ask how long in time a black-hole can live then if totally depends upon mass & if the black-hole is spinning(accreting it's mass)then
                  it is going to evaporate at all.Anyway, a modest black hole of, say, 5 times the mass of the Sun will take 2.6 * 10^69 years to evaporate. 
                  This is a ridiculously large number. Thatâ€™s 190 billion trillion trillion trillion trillion times the current age of the universe.
                  The main reason that a black-hole evaporate at a very slow rate is that they so much mass in trillions of trillions of kilograms, more
                  than the mass of hundrads & thousands of stars.

                <p class="py-2" style="color: #eee;">
                    The black hole at the center of our galaxy is thought to be about 4 million times the mass of the Sun. 
                    It would require 1.34 * 10^87 years to evaporate. Thatâ€™s more than 50 quadrillion times as long as the 5 solar mass black hole.
                    The most massive black hole known is estimated to be some 66 billion solar masses. It would require 6 * 10^99 years to evaporate. 
                    Thatâ€™s 0.6 googol years. Four and a half trillion times as long as the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy.
                    A small primordial black hole with a mass of 1.7 trillion kilograms would take 13.8 billion years, or the age of the universe.
                    A black hole with a mass of 119,000,000,000 kilograms would require about 4.5 billion years to die.

                <p class="py-2" style="color: #eee;">
                    A stellar-mass black hole, with a mass of tens of times the mass of the Sun, can likely form in seconds, 
                    after the collapse of a massive star. These relatively small black holes can also be made through the merger 
                    of two dense stellar remnants called neutron stars. A neutron star can also merge with a black hole to make 
                    a bigger black hole, or two black holes can collide. Mergers like these also make black holes quickly, 
                    and produce ripples in space-time called gravitational waves. for saggitarius A*, It can take less than a billion years for one to reach a very large size, 
                    but it is unknown how long it takes them to form, generally.

                <h5 style="color:#eee">Danger</h5>
                <p class="py-2" style="color: #eee;">
                    No. There is no way a black hole would eat an entire galaxy or the entire universe. 
                    The gravitational reach of supermassive black holes contained in the middle of galaxies is large, 
                    but not nearly large enough for eating the whole galaxy.Fortunately, this has never happened to anyone â€” 
                    black holes are too far away to pull in any matter from our solar system. 
                    But scientists have observed black holes ripping stars apart, a process that releases a tremendous amount of energy.
                    And yeah, The Sun will never turn into a black hole because it is not massive enough to explode. Instead, the Sun will become a dense stellar remnant called a white dwarf.
